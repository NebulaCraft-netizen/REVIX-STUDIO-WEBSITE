    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      REVIX Studio started as a small group of passionate Roblox players who wanted something more from FPS games.
      Tired of clunky mechanics, pay-to-win models, and uninspired design, we decided to take matters into our own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      What began as late-night brainstorming sessions has evolved into a fully committed development team. With scripters,
      modelers, animators, and designers working hand in hand, we are creating games that push Roblox to its limits.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We want to be known as the studio that revolutionized Roblox FPS. Not just for creating games, but for building
      communities. REVIX Studio is where competitive spirit meets creativity, where every player has a role in shaping
      the future of our games.
