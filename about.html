  <h2>About REVIX Studio</h2>
  <p>
    REVIX Studio was born from a vision: to create the most polished and immersive Roblox FPS ever built.
    Our story begins with a group of passionate developers who met inside the Roblox community. 
    Instead of just playing, we dreamed of building something bigger—an FPS game that could compete with
    traditional shooters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is more than just “making games.” We aim to bring professional workflows into Roblox,
    combining code, artistry, and design into one seamless pipeline. We are committed to innovation,
    community engagement, and raising the bar of what Roblox games can be.

    and the future of Roblox gaming here—text trimmed for brevity.]
